# Ablaevent Node.js Library

> **PLEASE NOTE** From version 2.0.0 onwards, `ablaevent-node` is now based on our [TypeScript Core]


## Releasing a new version

Just bump up `version` in `package.json` on the main branch and the new version will be published automatically.

It's advised to use `bump patch/minor/major` label on PRs - that way the above will be done automatically
when the PR is merged.

## Thanks

This library is largely based on the `analytics-node` package.
